# Numerical Optimization

This repository stores all my codes for the Numerical Optimization course, and it basically consists of the following three chapters (concerning unconstrained optimization):

- Chapter 1: Newton-type methods
- Chapter 2: Non-linear conjugate gradient methods
- Chapter 3: Non-linear least squares problem

All codes are implemented in Python. Numerical reports are also attached to illustrate the problem background and the algorithm principles. Encapsulation is done best in Chapter 3.
